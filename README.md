=============

I have used playgrounds to write all the demo code. The Xcode beta's that I was using during the training sessions seemed to lack stability and performance optimizations (as can be expected from any beta software). The impact was that once I had added my 6th playground, xcode kept crashing. This forced me to split my code samples between multiple projects and that prevented me from uploading this project earlier as a single project. Xcode 6.1.1 is pretty stable now, and not just because I have upgraded to a quad core 16GB MacBook Pro. I notice that it does not try to run all the playgrounds simultaneously. This might be why It doesn't seem to crash even after I a few more playgrounds into a single project. So my plan is to put all the code samples together into a single project to make it easier for the students. But, in case this project crashes Xcode for you, let me know and I will create a branch in which I will split the project into two.
