SwiftTutorial
=============

In Jul-2014, I taught an informal class on the Swift Programming Language to my colleagues at Amazon. These are the code samples I used in that class.   

The class was split into three sessions. In each session I went as far as we could based on the complexity of the topics and the length of the discussions permitted. Each session was an hour long, and discussions took up as much as 15 minutes of the entire session.  

The Swift syntax changed between sessions (e.g. the range operator switched from .. to ..< between my first and second sessions), and even more after the three sessions were over. So I am going to revamp the code samples in order to work with the changes.  

I have used playgrounds to write all the demo code. The Xcode beta's that I was using during the training sessions seemed to lack stability and performance optimizations (as can be expected from any beta software). The impact was that once I had added my 6th playground, xcode kept crashing. This forced me to split my code samples between multiple projects and that prevented me from uploading this project earlier as a single project. Xcode 6.1.1 is pretty stable now, and not just because I have upgraded to a quad core 16GB MacBook Pro. I notice that it does not try to run all the playgrounds simultaneously. This might be why It doesn't seem to crash even after I a few more playgrounds into a single project. So my plan is to put all the code samples together into a single project to make it easier for the students. But, in case this project crashes Xcode for you, let me know and I will create a branch in which I will split the project into two.
